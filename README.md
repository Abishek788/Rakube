# Video Transcoding Platform

A scalable, event-driven Video Transcoding Platform built on AWS, designed to handle video uploads, transcoding, and global delivery with low latency and high availability. This project leverages AWS services to provide a secure, serverless solution for efficient video processing, with a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment and infrastructure management.

## Overview

This platform allows users to upload videos, which are then transcoded and delivered globally in under 60 seconds, ensuring a seamless viewing experience with 99.9% uptime. Real-time analytics provide insights into user engagement and system performance.

## Key Features

- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Built on AWS Lambda and S3 event triggers for efficient, asynchronous processing.
- **Containerized Processing**: Utilizes Docker containers with ECS Fargate to transcode videos, ensuring consistent performance and scalability.
- **Global Content Delivery**: AWS CloudFront is integrated for quick video delivery with minimal latency.
- **Secure User Authentication**: AWS Cognito and WAF for enhanced security and threat mitigation.
- **Real-Time Analytics**: AWS Kinesis provides insights into user behavior, helping optimize video delivery for a large number of concurrent users.

The platform architecture consists of:

1. **AWS S3**: For video uploads and storage, triggering the transcoding workflow.
2. **AWS Lambda**: Processes S3 events and triggers the ECS tasks for transcoding.
3. **Amazon ECS Fargate**: Runs Docker containers for video transcoding tasks.
4. **AWS CloudFront**: Delivers transcoded videos globally with low latency.
5. **AWS CloudFormation**: Manages infrastructure as code, enabling rapid deployment and scaling.
6. **AWS WAF & Cognito**: Ensures secure user authentication and protects against threats.
7. **AWS Kinesis**: Streams real-time analytics for user engagement monitoring.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **AWS Account**: An AWS account with permissions to access S3, ECS, Lambda, CloudFront, and other necessary services.
- **Docker**: For creating and testing container images locally.
- **AWS CLI**: For managing AWS resources and deploying CloudFormation stacks.


### Usage

1. **Uploading Videos**: Videos can be uploaded directly to the S3 bucket, which triggers the transcoding workflow.
2. **Accessing Transcoded Videos**: Once processed, videos are available for streaming via the CloudFront distribution.
3. **Monitoring**: Access real-time analytics through AWS Kinesis to monitor user engagement and system performance.

## CI/CD Pipeline

The CI/CD pipeline is managed with CodePipeline, enabling automated testing and deployment with each update. The setup includes:

- **GitHub Actions**: For source control and version management.
- **AWS CodePipeline**: Manages the build and deployment stages.
- **AWS CloudFormation**: Deploys infrastructure updates automatically.
